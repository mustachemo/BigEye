# Global News Coverage Trends Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze trends in global news coverage by leveraging the vast and comprehensive GDELT dataset hosted on Google's BigQuery. The primary focus is to uncover patterns and shifts in media focus globally, providing insights into how different events are covered across various regions and time periods.

## Objectives

The initial phase of the project will focus on:

- **Identifying major trends** in global news coverage over the past decade.
- **Highlighting significant spikes** in media coverage related to specific global events.
- **Comparing frequency and depth** of coverage across different continents and countries.

## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from the [GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/), which monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes, images and events driving our global society every second of every day.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Google BigQuery**: for querying and managing large datasets.
- **Python**: for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: for data visualization.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: for project and API management.
